Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Node.js (for optional frontend tooling)

Supabase account

OpenAI API account

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd food-health-detector
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask flask-cors openai supabase python-dotenv
Set up environment variables:

bash
cp .env.example .env
Edit .env with your credentials:

text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
Initialize the database:

sql
CREATE DATABASE food_health;
USE food_health;

CREATE TABLE food_analyses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    food_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_organic BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    age_group ENUM('child', 'teenage', 'adult', 'elder') NOT NULL,
    recommendations JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Run the Flask application:

bash
python app.py
Frontend Setup
The frontend is contained in a single HTML file that can be directly opened in a browser, or served via the Flask backend.

For development with live reload, you can use a simple HTTP server:

bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server

Supabase Integration
The application uses Supabase for realtime database functionality:

Create a Supabase account and project at https://supabase.com

Create a table called food_analyses with appropriate columns

Add your Supabase URL and key to the environment variables

OpenAI Integration
The application uses OpenAI's API to generate food recommendations:

Sign up for an OpenAI API key at https://platform.openai.com

Add your API key to the environment variables

The application will use the API to generate age-specific recommendations

Customization
You can extend the application by:

Adding more food items to the organic/inorganic lists

Customizing the recommendation prompts for OpenAI

Adding more age groups or dietary preferences

Implementing user profiles and history

Adding more detailed nutritional information
